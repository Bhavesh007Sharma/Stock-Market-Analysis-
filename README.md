Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis indicator that consists of a moving average and two standard deviation lines that are plotted two standard deviations away from the moving average. These bands are used to identify potential price reversals, double bottoms, and market volatility. The Bollinger Band Squeeze is a signal that suggests a period of low volatility is about to end and a period of high volatility is about to begin. The Ehler Fisher Transform and the Elder Force Index are indicators that can be used in conjunction with Bollinger Bands to identify potential trend changes. The Elder Ray Index is a momentum indicator that can also be used with Bollinger Bands. The Fratcal chaos Bands are a variation of Bollinger Bands that incorporate fractal chaos theory to identify potential market turning points.
